# Friction Logging Toolkit

If you're a product developer, you know that frictionless user experience is key to success. Being able to effectively capture and distill feedback from end users is tricky, but essential. That's why we've developed a friction logging toolkit, to help you get the most out of your user feedback.

This toolkit includes a friction logging template, which you can use to track user feedback and identify areas of friction. We also include some resources to get you started with friction logging.

The resources here are a jumping-off point - they are not meant to be prescriptive, but rather to give you some ideas and inspiration for how you can use friction logging to improve your product development process.
