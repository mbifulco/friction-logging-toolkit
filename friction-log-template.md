## Context

I recently had the task of setting up a new printer for my office. The process was relatively simple, but there were a few things I had to keep in mind in order to get the printer up and running smoothly. This is a summary of my experience, from choosing a printer, to unboxing it, installing it on my machine, and testing it out with a few sample prints.

Overall, the process was reasonable, although I did find room for improvement in the initial software setup experience, and installing/replacing new ink cartridges.

## Pros

- Documentation was clearly organized
- The setup process only took a few minutes
- The docs website was mobile-friendly

## Cons

- The docs can feel a bit long - Video tutorials would have been helpful

## Stream of consciousness

When I unboxed the printer, I wanted to set it up right away, so I headed to the [website](https://example.com), but struggled to find the link to the docs for a few minutes. When I found it though, I got the device connected to my WiFi network pretty quickly. The instructions were very clear and easy to follow.

I then tried to print a document from my laptop. The process was very simple, and similar to other printers that I've used in the past, which was a good experience. Not having to learn a new workflow for a device such as a printer is always good.

Them I moved on to trying to print a document from a USB sticl. This process was a little more confusing. The UI on the screen of the printer shows icons that are not strightforward to understand

(...etc)
